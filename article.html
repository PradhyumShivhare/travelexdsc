The states have a lot to offer, from having the cleanest village in Asia to India’s oldest oil refinery in Assam, and you know where the fun lies? mostly all the seven sisters have International boundaries. The largest monastery in India also happens to be in Arunachal Pradesh known as the Tawang Monastery, the highest average rainfall on Earth happens to be in Mawsynram, Meghalaya and do you know about the undivided dynasty of India, which ruled for nearly 600 years!! Well, this is just a gist, and here’s a welcome to know more about what the Seven Sisters and their Only Brother have to offer.</p> <br>

This includes Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. all the seven states are hugely dependent on each other and share great similarities in its biodiversity, religions, political, economy and culture. But, sadly Sikkim is not part of the seven sisters a sit is separated by a chicken neck corridor or Siliguri corridor. A tiny strip of land in the northern region of  Bengal joins the North East with the rest of India.</p>

                        <p class="blog_para">Manipur was once regarded as one of the princely states of the British Empire. The state shares an international border with Myanmar. During the 1930’s Manipur was being cut off from the Indian region. The Britishers wanted Manipur to be part of Myanmar. But, after many negotiations, on the 11th of August 1947, Maharaja Budhachandra signed an Instrument of Accession and hence, Manipur became a permanent part of India. Manipur is home to the Meitei tribe that occupies the majority of the state. Apart from them, the Naga and Kuki-Zo tribe are also found. Manipur is rich in its flora. The state’s economy and the people of Manipur are hugely depended on the cultivation of a varied variety of plantations. Surrounded by the Naga hills in the north, the Mizo and Chin hills in the south, the Manipur hills in the west and the green valleys (Rice Bowl of Manipur) hold a prestigious spot in the eyes as rice is the staple food of Manipur.

                            <p class="blog_para">The state of Mizoram translates into the ‘Land of the Mizos’. It is a landlocked state that shares its borders with Indian states Tripura, Assam and Manipur and the international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh. Mizoram was earlier part of Assam but in 1972 was converted into a union territory. Mizoram with a mere population of 22,000 people is the least populated state of the country. the state is known for a vibrant amalgamation of various tribes such as the Dulien, Ralte, Poi, Jahao, Pankhup, Mar and nine more tribes. Mizoram is known for its natural beauty. The Phawngpui Tlang also known as the Blue Mountain is the highest peak in Mizoram at 2,210 metres. The state is covered by thick forests as but the state frequently follows the Slash and burn cultivation method. Also known as the fire fallow cultivation, it involves cutting and burning of plants to create a swidden or a filed. Even though the Slash and burn method is banned in Mizoram, many people still practice this method. Hence, this has been a huge cause for affecting its terrain. The Mim Kut, Pawl Kut and Chapchar Kut are some of the famous festivals of Mizoram.</p> <br>

The agriculture sector is the main sector for Tripura’s economy. Despite Tripura is one of the top literate states of India with 87.75%, the people sadly face poverty and unemployment. The major tribal groups are Reang, Tripura, Noatia, Debbarma, Jamatia, and fourteen more tribes that migrated to Tripura as tea labourers. The state exudes a blend of tribal and Bengali culture that can be prominently witnessed during the colourful and vibrant celebration of their festivals. Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Ashokastami and Dolyatra are some of the important festivals of the state. Bengali is the most widely spoken language in Tripura. Kokborok is a prominent language of the Tripura tribes. Various other languages such as Mog, Halam, Garo  Manipuri and Manipuri are spoken here. The capital of Tripura is Agartala. </p>
